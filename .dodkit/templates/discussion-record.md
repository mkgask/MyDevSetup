# Decision Record: {discussion-id}

## Metadata
- Created At: YYYY-MM-DD
- Scope: One-line scope

## Notes
- This file is append-only discussion history.
- Do not add mutable tracking fields here (status, remaining work, open action items).
- Do not keep open-question backlogs here. If clarification is needed, ask in chat and append the resolved facts.
- If a fact becomes a binding implementation constraint, promote it to DECISIONS.yml.
- Keep each entry as short as the discussion allows.
- Evidence and detailed promotion metadata are optional; omit them when the entry stays clear without them.

Record boundary guidance:
- Keep one record focused on one cohesive decision theme. If an independent question, component, or follow-up appears, start a new record with a new `discussion-id` instead of extending unrelated history. Mention the prior record in `Evidence / references` when the new discussion continues from it.
- Use a practical reviewability signal: when a record reaches roughly 10 entries or 1,000 words, close it at a natural boundary and continue in a new record with a new `discussion-id`. This is a heuristic, not a hard parser-enforced limit; stay in the current record only when the next same-theme entry remains concise and reviewable.

Append rules:
- Append at EOF only; do not edit earlier sections.
- Do not add status tracking or remaining-work items.
